## Creating a Plan

1. Use template: `.claude/TEMPLATES/plan.md`

- [ ] All steps marked `[x]` complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] "Key Discoveries" filled in
- [ ] "Future Improvements" has 2+ items
- [ ] **Improvements extracted to BACKLOG.md** (categorized appropriately)
- [ ] Summary added to `../DONE.md`
