## Active Tasks

### UI/UX Improvements

- [ ] **Video fullscreen toggle on second click** — Clicking on a video a second time when it is open in fullscreen mode should close fullscreen, not zoom in
  - Plan: [2025-12-29_video-fullscreen-toggle.md](plans/2025-12-29_video-fullscreen-toggle.md)
  - Status: Implementation complete, awaiting testing

- [ ] **Visual media scale controls** — Add a visual interface for manipulating media scale (zoom) in both fullscreen and normal modes. Should work in both single mode and compare mode
