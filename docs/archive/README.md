# Documentation Archive

Archived documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for historical reference.

## Archive Criteria

Documents are moved here when:
- The work they describe is complete and merged
- They contain only historical context (no active guidance)
- They are superseded by newer documentation
- They haven't been referenced in >6 months

## Retrieving Archived Documents

If you need information from an archived document:
1. Check if the information exists in current documentation first
2. If not, the archived document may still be useful for historical context
3. Consider whether the information should be added to current docs

## Plan Archive Process

```text
docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_task.md  →  docs/archive/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_task.md
```

Before archiving a plan, verify:

- All steps marked complete
- "Key Discoveries" section filled
- "Future Improvements" has 2+ items
- Improvements extracted to BACKLOG.md (categorized appropriately)
- Summary added to docs/planning/DONE.md
- .claude/plans/ copy deleted (if exists)

**See [plans/README.md](plans/README.md) for complete step-by-step archive process.**
